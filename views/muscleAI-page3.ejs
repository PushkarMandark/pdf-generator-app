    <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold  mb-12">METHODOLOGY </h2>
    <p class="text-lx mb-4">The intelligence pipeline behind 1BUY is designed for accuracy, scale, and actionability.
        Here's how data is
        transformed into insights:</p>
    <div class="my-2">
        <div>
            <h3 class="font-bold">1. Ingestion & Unification</h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-1 mx-4 mb-4">
                Bill of Materials (BOMs), ERP exports, distributor APIs, and tariff feeds are streamed into the
                centralized lake. LLM-powered entity extraction and fuzzy MPN resolution bring structure to messy,
                unstandardized inputs.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 class="font-bold">2. Cleaning & Enrichment</h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-1 mx-4 mb-4">
                Data is deduplicated and enriched with lifecycle status (e.g., EOL, NRND), compliance attributes, and
                standardized currencies. This step ensures every record is analysis-ready.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 class="font-bold">3. Model Training & Forecasting</h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-1 mx-4 mb-4">
                Temporal models (XGBoost, Prophet) are retrained nightly to refresh price predictions and flag emerging
                risks. These dynamic models respond to shifting market conditions, improving pricing accuracy over time.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 class="font-bold">4. Anomaly Detection</h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-1 mx-4 mb-4">
                Z-score algorithms run continuously to catch sudden cost anomalies, unauthorized supplier pricing, and
                grey-market deviations within minutes of detection.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 class="font-bold">5. Natural Language Insights</h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-1 mx-4 mb-4">
                Using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), alerts and recommendations are automatically translated into
                actionable plain-English insights and delivered to users through dashboards, APIs, or messaging
                platforms (e.g., Slack, Teams).
            </p>
        </div>

    <p class="italic text-sm text-gray-600 mt-6">
        This layered approach allows for real-time intelligence that is both reliable and immediately actionable
